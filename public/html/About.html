<h4><li>MrMucFeet: Drummer</li></h4>
<h2>
<p>
MrMucFeet, or Karlik, is considered one of the best drummers in all of Czechoslovakia.
He has generously come to us in order to help us become what we dream--become the top band in all of Czechoslovakia.
Karlik was born in Germany but moved to Czechoslovakia shortly after his birth. He went to Ada's primary school there and Advatka's
Secondary school. However, rather than going to Music school as it was his dream ever since his childhood, Karlik decided to teach
himself everything. It has gone a long way as he is in one of the top rising bands in Czechoslovakia. 
</p>

<h4><li>Bobbor Tenorvich: Lead Singer</li></h4>
<h2>
<p>
    Bobbor Tenorvich, or Pavlousek, is the creator of this whole group along with Vaclav. His passion in singing started ever since he was child where
    he would sing for the family at holidays or functions. He was born native to Czechoslovakia and went to school with Vaclav. Pavlousek and Vaclav
    became really close friends as they went through school and they would make little songs that they would play just for fun.Later on, Pavlousek
    and Vaclav would both play at talent shows in their school and they would play so good as to get funded by the school themselves to start their
    own band. With all this money saved up, Pavlousek and Vaclav would play at their first concert at the local theater in their town.
    </p>
    </h2>
    <h4><li>Bobby Smoeyo: Guitarist</li></h4>
    <h2>
    <p>
    Bobby Smoeyo, or Vaclav, has played the guitar like someone would practice religion. He was born in Czechoslovakia and went to the same school
    as Pavlousek and they became best of buds throughout the years. They played in concerts after school and eventually ran into Karlik and they instantly
    realized that they could actually make a living off of this new band that had just been formed. Thus, the Yeetersons were created and they 
    have come a long way since their beginnings 2 years ago.
